      <p> Most people may say : “ iPhones have the best cameras.”, while
        this statement may be true a couple years back, the present
        situation is different. The latest Samsung flagship S21 Ultra has a
        better camera system than iPhone 13 pro max according to many
        tech reviewers. This also reflects the improvements Samsung has
        brought to its camera hardware and photo capturing algorithms.
        Moreover, with the use of telephoto camera, the maximum zoom
        capabilities of Samsung are much greater than Apple. Samsung
        also uses a much higher megapixel count for their cameras which
        results in photos with plenty of sharpness. But Apple has its
        strengths too, the videos captured by iPhone cameras are still
        unmatchable in quality. So, in conclusion, both Samsung and Apple
        have a great camera system, both have large camera sensors,
        optical image stabilisation and excellent image processing.It's a
        tie!

            Samsung uses Qualcomm Snapdragon or their own Exynos
            processors and Apple uses their A-series bionic chipsets. While all
            these chipsets are extremely fast and it's really hard to spot any
            difference between their performances, when you dive deep and
            look closely, the A-series bionic chipsets are more capable with
            better optimizations, then comes Qualcomm Snapdragon and then
            EXYNOS.
